# ReCoRe - The Research Code Reproducibility project

### What is reproducibility
A foundational principle in the scientific method is the ability to test claims from other scientists by experimentation. Academic publications abound with claims of 'state of the art' techniques and approaches that push societies knowledge forward and it is more important than ever to be able to verify claims by reproducing the results. 

Reproducibility, therefore, is the ability for researcher A reading researcher B's work to confirm the scientific findings for themselves.

### What is reproducible code
In the Mathsys Doctoral programme (Warwick University, UK) our discipline is, broadly, Mathematics. In mathematical research, code is used to model, describe, calculate and optimise. Our code will perform often complex tasks that are grounded in bleeding edge theory. When researchers seek to confirm your results well written code will allow them to easily run your initial experiment and, importantly, find your code illuminates their understanding of the process. Reproducible code will therefore be 
* Readable
* Runnable
* Commented
* Modular

### Reproducible data
Not all projects are reproducible, nor should they be. There will be cases where the data is sensitive or other issues mean you are unable to release the project as a whole. For a great many projects you can seek approval to publish the data-set with your code, giving other scientists the opportunity to re-run your experiments. 

### Why write repoducible code?
There are many reasons why reproducible code is both important and helpful to a variety of people within the academic framework
* Collaborators
Collaborators will benefit from clear, well described code. They can offer insight, support and at the very least not be emailing you constantly for clarifications. 
* Self collaboration
Collaborating with yourself in 6 months time, when you have not looked at your code for that period can be tough. It's a lot easier if your code is clear, well explained and robust.
* Reviewers
Academic reviewers are becoming more interested in reproducibility. If a reviewer can view your code, run your code and understand your code with relative ease this process will be smoother.

### When not to write repoducible code
There's never a reason not to write repoducible code. Even if the code is proprietry and protected, someone may have to run it at some point and writing good code will be beneficial during and after the project is finished, even if it is never shared.
