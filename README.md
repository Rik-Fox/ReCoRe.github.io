# ReCoRe - The Research Code Reproducibility project

## What is reproducibility
A foundational principle in the scientific method is the ability to test claims from other scientists by experimentation. Indeed, as Academic publications abound with claims of 'state of the art' techniques and approaches that push societies knowledge forward, it is, perhaps, more important than ever to be able to verify claims by reproducing the results. 

Reproducibility, therefore, is the ability for researcher A reading researcher B's work to confirm the scientific findings for themselves.
